This is a website developed by Mathew Schlichting and Ben Taufen. 
We developed this software using JQuery and various node packages.

To run:
  Install all required node packages
  Ensure the database is in the project folder at the same level as src/ and Webcontent/
  Run "node src/server.js" to start the server
  It will load necessary lists from the database and start listening
  Wait until all lists are loaded in and the console displays 'Now listening at [port]'
  Access the webserver from your browser and enjoy!
